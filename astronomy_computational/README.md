Directory for a pair of computational projects primarily worked on during an advanced astronomy course (Fall 2020) mainly in relation to stars; some further
personal exploration was involved afterwards.

The Kepler project relates to numerically computing Keplerian orbits using three methods of integration: Forward Euler, Second-Order Runge-Kutta (RK2), and Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta (RK4).
The ZAMS project relates to computed stellar parameters of low-mass stars and seeing how they vary depending on p+p reaction rates; by finding the radius at which the 
surface luminosity is equal to the nuclear luminosity, we could also determine the zero-aged main-sequence for low mass stars.
