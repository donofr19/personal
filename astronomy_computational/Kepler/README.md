Kepler
======

Project directory for comparison of ODE solvers and usage of the solvers to integrate orbits of two point particles (Kepler's problem).

Contents of this directory
--------------------------

*  `README.md`  
This file

*  `ode.py`  
Routines to advance the solution of a system of first-order ODEs by one step

*  `kepler.py`  
Routines to integrate orbits and compute energies for two particles interacting 
via an attractive 1/r potential

* `part4.py`
Uses the three integration methods from ode.py to integrate the equations of motion
over three orbital periods and computes the relative error. 

* `Part5.py`
For the extremes the projectiles trajectory is plotted. The corresponding potential, kinetic
and total energies are also graphed.

* `Kepler_Project_Report.pdf`
