Exploration of planetary parameters for exoplanet 51 Pegasi b using Markov chain Monte Carlo Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm fitting method. This quick notebook written with spare time during the spring 2020 semester was inspired by a common 'Traveling Salesmen' MCMC problem that was introduced in a computational course to further grasp this interesting algorithm; Python-based.
